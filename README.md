#Holiday Homework (Contacts Project)

* This basic AngularJS application allows for creation and deletion of contacts and their information. It was created during course of a holiday break to allow for practice of our most recently learned concepts related to Angular.
* The application will be revisited when we learn how to access a REST API in the new year.
